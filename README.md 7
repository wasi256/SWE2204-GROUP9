# Software Cost Metrics (Chapter 7)

## Description
This document provides an overview of software cost estimation, covering various models and techniques used to predict the effort and time required to develop software systems [cite: 411, 412, 413, 414]. It discusses cost models, constraint models, and specific examples like COCOMO and SLIM [cite: 415, 416].
